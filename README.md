# phishing_detector for emails

This project is a Fake Phishing Email Detector that connects to an email inbox using IMAP and scans unread emails for phishing indicators. 
It checks for common phishing keywords like "verify your account" or "urgent action required."
If a phishing attempt is detected, the system sends an alert email to notify the user. 
This helps in identifying and preventing email-based cyber threats.
